Another option is to execute the following:
args = c("Diff26_c2_data.csv",
         "26_c2_copy_den_plots.pdf", "26_c2_TX_plots.pdf", "26_c2_heter_plots.pdf",
         "26_c2_copyN.csv", "26_c2_TX.csv", "26_c2_heter.csv")
#  
#The first argument is the data to be read,  
#arguments 2-4 are the names of the pdf files to be created containing the plots,  
#arguments 5-7 are the names of the csv files to be created cotaining the extracted data  
  
```{r}
wd <- getwd()
setwd("..")
parent <- getwd()

file <- read.csv("./input/Diff26_c2_data.csv")

setwd(wd)

# To remove any row where the area = 0 due to clicking on a point during cell segmentation
file <- file[file$cell.area != 0, ]
pander(head(file), style = "rmarkdown")
```
  
```{r}
